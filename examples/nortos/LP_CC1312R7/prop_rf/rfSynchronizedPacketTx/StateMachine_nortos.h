/*
A simple state machine (SM) module for task-level execution.

This module allows to implement non-hierarchical state machines. States are
implemented as functions and may process events that are posted from interrupt
handlers and driver callbacks. The state machine executes in task context and
all events are dispatched with the same priority as the task.


Usage
=====

1. Draw a UML state chart of your application. Use a simple
   program like plantuml.

2. Declare the state machine and all the states you need in your
   application source file:

   StateMachine_Struct stateMachine;

   StateMachine_DEFINE_STATE(SetupState);
   StateMachine_DEFINE_STATE(RxState);
   StateMachine_DEFINE_STATE(TxState);

3. You might also want to define some events:

   typedef enum {
       PacketReceivedEvent = StateMachine_Event_00,
       TransmitPacketEvent = StateMachine_Event_01
   };

   Events will be processed while executing state handler functions.

4. Define state handler functions for each state in your application
   source file:

   void SetupState_function() { ... }
   void RxStateState_function() { ... }

5. Fill the state handler functions with content. Each state exeutes in 3
   phaes: entry, event handling, exit. A typical state looks like:

   void RxState_function() {
       // Entry: Start RX ...

       // Event handling
       for (;;) {
           StateMachine_EventMask events = StateMachine_pendEvent(&stateMachine, PacketReceivedEvent | TransmitPacketEvent);

           if (events & PacketReceivedEvent) {
               // handle packet
           }
           if (events & TransmitPacketEvent) {
               StateMachine_setNextState(&stateMachine, TxState);
               break;
           }
       }

       // Exit: Leave Rx ... ...
   }

6. Events are posted from hardware interrupt handlers or callbacks:

   void buttonCallbackFunction() {
       StateMachine_postEvent(&stateMachine, TransmitPacketEvent);
   }

7. Finally, setup and start the state machine:

   StateMachine_construct(&stateMachine);
   int exitCode = StateMachine_exec(&stateMachine, SetupState);
